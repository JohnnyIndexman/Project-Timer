# Console-Based Digital Clock Application

## Overview

This is a **console-based digital clock application** built in **Java**. The application offers three key modes:

-  **Watch** – Displays the current system time.
-  **Stopwatch** – Measures elapsed time
-  **Timer** – Counts down from a user-specified duration.

## Project Goals

- Apply **Java EE fundamentals** to create a practical time-related application.
- Practice using **time and date objects** (`LocalTime`, `Duration`, etc.).
- Enhance skills in **handling user input** and managing application **state**.
- Implement **mode switching** within a single cohesive program.

## Features

- Real-time display of current time.
- Countdown timer with user input for custom duration.
- User-friendly console interface for mode selection and control.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Java Console I/O
- `java.time` package for time handling

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
